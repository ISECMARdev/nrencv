By using an institution where regular internet connectivity is already present, a pilot implementation will showcase eduroam and many other functionalities to the academic community of different institutions on Cape Verde island. In a break from traditional approaches, the project will use virtualization network functions running on clouds - in different geographical locations - in a multi homing approach. Although one of the goals of the project is to deploy eduroam in Cape Verde, G\u00c9ANT\u2019s RARE and RNP\u2019s NosFVeraTO R&D main products will be deployed together to provide security and smart routing on cloud-based overlay networking - demonstrating how far a clean-slate NREN could go in reducing TCO. We believe that this approach has the potential of not only encouraging developing countries to deploy their NRENs, but also to produce a blueprint for consolidated NRENS - helping them to expand their reach and service catalogue in a cost-effective way. Overview The main goal of the project is to create, deploy and test a new framework for new NRENs which arise in developing countries. It will also provide a blueprint for existing NRENS to expand both connectivity and services to their member institutions while reducing the budget required to deliver these services. Our goal with a showcasing activity in Cape Verde is to build a community and to raise local awareness of other stakeholders in NRENs through the demonstration of cloud-centered services. Community-building and stakeholder awareness for supporting the creation of sustainable NRENs in developing countries can benefit from cloud-based quick deployment of relevant services, such as eduroam, where regular connectivity is already present. Our innovation strategy involves aggregating proven solutions from past and current NREN R&D projects, such as RARE and eduroam itself, with private cloud-based NFV developed in NosFVeraTO from Brazil\u2019s NREN RNP [4] . Development efforts will mainly focus on: i) security; ii) services; and iii) network control & management of such a system. Our future ambition is that our open networking cloud-based NREN solution could be considered as a viable architecture by consolidated NRENs, such as MoRENET in Mozambique, and also by federations of NRENs like the West And Central African Research and Education Network WACREN.

The main physical device that needs to be deployed is an edge platform that acts as an access point or conduit from the public and internal sides of the ReNaaS platform. NREN Services Programmability of Network Equipment and Infrastructures Access Networks Expected Impact As far as strategically positioning NRENs, the main impact is to lower the bar for new NRENs to arise in developing countries, as well as to provide a blueprint for existing NRENS to expand both connectivity and services to their member institutions with much reduced impact to their budget. Our goal with a showcasing activity in Cape Verde is to develop both community building and an approach for raising local awareness of other stakeholders in NRENs through the demonstration of cloud-centered services. Before testing in Cape Verde, the RENaaS solution will first be verified by TCD in Ireland. This will allow the RENaaS solution to be functional validated prior to trialing with real users in Cape Verde.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#overview","text":"The main goal of the project is to create, deploy and test a new framework for new NRENs which arise in developing countries.

In the present era, the strategy already proven with positive results internationally has been to create National Research and Education Networks (NRENs) to effectively reduce the digital divide, strengthen communication and collaboration between educational and research institutions, promote sharing resources and comprehensively improve the national level of research and education. NRENs seek to improve resources to support collaboration in teaching, learning and research. Of the 54 countries on our continent, most have already formalized and operational support structures for their respective NRENs, as these are essential to provide advanced ICT services to research and education communities, according to the specificities that involve the use of ICT in the academic scope. Higher education and research institutions (IESI) are part of a context increasingly defined by collaborative networks and transnational consortia, therefore the existence of the NREN makes it possible to forge network infrastructures that can be solutions to real problems such as insufficient bandwidth , low reliability and cybersecurity threats. In this context, regional associations of NRES are already a reality in our continent, as is the case of the existing one in our sub-region called WACREN - West and Central African NRENs. In implementation by WACREN we highlight the Africa Connect 3 project. Co-funded by the European Commission (EC) the project aims to support the creation, development and use of advanced and reliable Internet connectivity for the teaching, learning and research communities of Africa western. If, on the one hand, these institutions necessarily have the financial support of different partners (public investments, funding from international partners), on the other hand, they are always initiatives of higher education and research institutions, meaning that the inclusion of Cape Verde in such networks must be based on in an NREN Cape Verde. This, in addition to serving and supporting the entire national academic community, would represent our country in the context of international NREN associations. And it was with this assumption that with the leadership of the UTA, specifically ISECMAR professors, together with representatives as professors and professionals in the field of computing and computer engineering from almost all higher education institutions in Cape Verde, we are joining forces to propose the creation of NREN Cape Verde. Benefits of Cabo Verde National Research and Education Network to be defined Cabo Verde NREN Conceptually, the NRENs are first and foremost a community of academics and researchers and the network that is implemented by the operationalization of the NREN is the support infrastructure resulting from academic activity and research. With this assumption, contact has already been established, in an informal first phase, with all the teachers and professionals in the areas of ICT from the following universities: ISCEE, UNIMIndelo, UniPiaget, UNICV and we have met with a view to materializing the NREN Cape Verde project. Working at a conceptual level for now, we seek to define the nature of an organization to operationalize the NREN. From the research carried out, we found that there are many models of NREN governance, and the most adopted approach is to establish an NREN as a non-profit association, or a foundation. We also find that as a government ministry, be it Education, Higher Education, Science and Technology, or Communications, they are important partners. However, it is considered vital that the academic community is strongly represented in the management structures of the NREN, because without stakeholder ownership an NREN can fail. Bearing these elements in mind, it is therefore necessary for the success of the NREN to have government involvement at the highest level.","title":"CVNREN"},{"location":"nren/#rationale-for-national-research-and-education-network","text":"At all times, supporting research and education has proven to be fundamental for the development of nations.
