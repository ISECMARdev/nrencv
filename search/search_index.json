By using an institution where regular internet connectivity is already present, a pilot implementation will showcase eduroam and many other functionalities to the academic community of different institutions on Cape Verde island. In a break from traditional approaches, the project will use virtualization network functions running on clouds - in different geographical locations - in a multi homing approach. Although one of the goals of the project is to deploy eduroam in Cape Verde, G\u00c9ANT\u2019s RARE and RNP\u2019s NosFVeraTO R&D main products will be deployed together to provide security and smart routing on cloud-based overlay networking - demonstrating how far a clean-slate NREN could go in reducing TCO. We believe that this approach has the potential of not only encouraging developing countries to deploy their NRENs, but also to produce a blueprint for consolidated NRENS - helping them to expand their reach and service catalogue in a cost-effective way. Overview The main goal of the project is to create, deploy and test a new framework for new NRENs which arise in developing countries. It will also provide a blueprint for existing NRENS to expand both connectivity and services to their member institutions while reducing the budget required to deliver these services. Our goal with a showcasing activity in Cape Verde is to build a community and to raise local awareness of other stakeholders in NRENs through the demonstration of cloud-centered services. List of Participants Participant No Organization name Short name Country 1: Coordinator/Lead Partner College of the Holy and Undivided Trinity of Queen Elizabeth near Dublin TCD Ireland 2: Participant Universidade T\u00e9cnica do Atl\u00e2ntico UTA Cabo Verde 2: Participant Rede Nacional de Ensino Pesquisa: PoP-ES @UFES RNP/Vixphy Brasil Description of Work Community-building and stakeholder awareness for supporting the creation of sustainable NRENs in developing countries can benefit from cloud-based quick deployment of relevant services, such as eduroam, where regular connectivity is already present. Our innovation strategy involves aggregating proven solutions from past and current NREN R&D projects, such as RARE and eduroam itself, with private cloud-based NFV developed in NosFVeraTO from Brazil\u2019s NREN RNP [4] . Development efforts will mainly focus on: i) security; ii) services; and iii) network control & management of such a system. Our future ambition is that our open networking cloud-based NREN solution could be considered as a viable architecture by consolidated NRENs, such as MoRENET in Mozambique, and also by federations of NRENs like the West And Central African Research and Education Network WACREN. Project Innovation The current NREN context and enabling technologies ecosystem are introduced in a \u201cwhat if\u201d approach to highlight untapped innovation opportunities we are try to exploit in this proposal: To maximize flexibility and to reduce depreciation of technology, we adopt the principle of \u201cdeploy in software where possible; deploy in hardware where necessary\u201d. The main physical device that needs to be deployed is an edge platform that acts as an access point or conduit from the public and internal sides of the ReNaaS platform. NREN Services Programmability of Network Equipment and Infrastructures Access Networks Expected Impact As far as strategically positioning NRENs, the main impact is to lower the bar for new NRENs to arise in developing countries, as well as to provide a blueprint for existing NRENS to expand both connectivity and services to their member institutions with much reduced impact to their budget. Our goal with a showcasing activity in Cape Verde is to develop both community building and an approach for raising local awareness of other stakeholders in NRENs through the demonstration of cloud-centered services. Before testing in Cape Verde, the RENaaS solution will first be verified by TCD in Ireland. This will allow the RENaaS solution to be functional validated prior to trialing with real users in Cape Verde.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#renaas-project-documentation","text":"ReNaaS it is a project aims to design, implement, validate and showcase an architecture using an Emerging NREN off the west coast of Africa (Cape Verde).

Of course these features are restricted for a user as member of an admin account. For specific information on configuring EZ2Cloud see the Administrator documentation. Overview The functionalities and features you will find on these pages are related with the main goal of EZ2Cloud: provides a colaborative and distribuited platform that allows you define and apply all the elements required on a migration job from on server to another or from an on-premise server to a cloud service. To achieve this goal, EZ2Cloud relies in gathering data and produce information related with metada from files and folders located on a server network shared folder. Specifically the data that will be gatther from the users that actually works with the file servers contents in a distrubted and colaborative approach. The metadata gather from server will be mapped to entities representing files and folders on EZ2Cloud, allowing each user to apply to files amd folders some labels. To sum up the platform will presents the users some file and let them assign labels, owners and with all the data gather and processed later on an authorized user can create and export a file with items that will be the source data for the migration. In order to provide insight in with the concepts needed to properly use Ez2 Cloud, read the following articles Entities and Concepts Details Also in our documetantion you can find out Use cases how you can use EZ2Cloud features to implement better solutions on migratation file servers contents.
