Research and Education Network as a Service for Developing Nations (RENaaS)

This project aims to design, implement, validate and showcase an architecture using an Emerging NREN off the west coast of Africa (Cape Verde). 
By using an institution where regular internet connectivity is already present, a pilot implementation will showcase eduroam and many other 
functionalities to the academic community of different institutions on São Vicente island. In a break from traditional approaches, the project 
will use virtualised network functions running on clouds - in different geographical locations - in a multihoming approach. 
Although one of the goals of the project is to deploy eduroam in Cape Verde, GÉANT’s RARE and RNP’s NosFVeraTO R&D main products will be 
deployed together to provide security and smart routing on cloud-based overlay networking - demonstrating how far a clean-slate NREN could
go in reducing TCO. This has the potential of not only encouraging developing countries to deploy their NRENs, but also to produce a blueprint
for consolidated NRENS - helping them to expand their reach and service catalogue in a cost-effective way.
