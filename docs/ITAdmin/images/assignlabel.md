## Assign Labels

As you already know, you assign labels to categorize files and folders.
To do so first the administrator have to assign labels for the project you are working with.
When you have labels available, you just drag them into the files or folder you want.
Note that you can add as many labels as possible to a single file or folder, but you can always remove them.

The file explorer is the place where you can do that job.
When you click on a project it will appear.
