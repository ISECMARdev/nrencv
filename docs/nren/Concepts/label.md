## Semantic Label
<div style='text-align: justify;'>
<p>Semantic Labels or Labels for short, are the data elements defined by one word or two, and configured to represents a category, a subject in the context of a company, departament or bussiness in general. </p>

<p>
Labels will represents a set of terms and concepts that represent knowledge about a specific company, deparment, bussiness unit. 
</p>
 
<p>
The goal of creating these labels it is use them to allow a group of users that commonly use a shared network folder of company to organize, classify and categorize its content. The obvious advantage is that, files and folders with a costumized label which has a direct connection with the company's business and its organizational structure provides an enriched view of files and folders and makes it possible to streamline data migration processes.
</p>

<p>
The Labels are defined and configured by a user with Administrator role and are completely defined according to each tenant and each project. So the Labels that are displayed on the Tag List must be first defined and configured on the EZ2Cloud back-end.
