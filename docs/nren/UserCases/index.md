## Use cases
<div style='text-align: justify;'> 
<p>EZ2Cloud it is a software solution implemented to tackle a major issue in the context of a company File Server. A on-premiose file servers will tipically be used for multiple users mainly via a shared folder. However the data files does not have a formal structure based on the company entities and bussines concepts. Also in the course of time the file servers will have orphan item and no clear data ownership. </p>
<p>Of course this could be a problem when moving the File Server content and specially if the company is moving to a Cloud-based server. In both cases the end users would like to have a smooth transition and of course the IT support team would like to have a software tool to do the migration with no error and with a minimumm effort.</p>
