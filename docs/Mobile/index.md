## Overview

<div style='text-align: justify;'> 
<p>The functionalities and features you will find on these pages are related with the main goal of EZ2Cloud: provides a colaborative and distribuited platform that allows you define and apply all the elements required on a migration job from on server to another or from an on-premise server to a cloud service.</p> 
<p>To achieve this goal, EZ2Cloud relies in gathering data and produce information related with metada from files and folders located on a server network shared folder. Specifically the data that will be gatther from the users that actually works with the file servers contents in a distrubted and colaborative approach.</p>
<p>The metadata gather from server will be mapped to entities representing files and folders on EZ2Cloud, allowing each user to apply to files amd folders some labels. To sum up the platform will presents the users some file and let them assign labels, owners and with all the data gather and processed later on an authorized user can create and export a file with items that will be the source data for the migration.</p>
